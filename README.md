### networkmanager-dispatcher-tor
#### Yawning Angel (yawning at schwanenlied dot me)

A NetworkManager dispatch script to start/stop Tor depending on network
connectivity.  Written because Tor freaks out due to my Guard being
unreachable when I initially boot my laptop up, since it comes up with
WiFi disabled.
